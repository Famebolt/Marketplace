Social media can be an incredibly valuable tool in your marketing arsenal. Just spend a few minutes on your favorite social network, and you’ll start to see the benefits of good marketing: you're more likely to find new customers, reach a larger audience, and get feedback from people who might not otherwise have seen your product. One of the key elements for success is knowing how to leverage all the tools available in social media.



The benefits of social media marketing go far beyond the typical metrics, such as fan and follower counts. Let’s take a look at some of the best ways to use social media to your advantage.



1. Share Blog Posts – This is one of the best places for social media marketing tips because it allows you to quickly reach a high volume of people in an efficient manner. By sharing a blog post on Facebook, you can put your message into front of thousands in less than an hour. Most consumers will read more than one article from your site during that time, so you’re reaching more than one person at a time with each share.



2. Use Facebook Ads – Facebook advertising can be a great way to target your audience and make money. This method is similar to other forms of paid advertising, but you are able to reach your prospects through social media outlets. The people who use these social networks are all potential customers, so it makes great sense to market directly at them.



3. Retargeting – Retargeting is another great example of marketing at the right person by the right message at the right time. You can target new customers with retargeting ads on display networks such as Google AdWords or through Facebook's ad manager tool or web interface.



4. Use Social Media As A Communication Tool – Make sure your company is active on social media to help build your brand and increase your customer base. Tweet about relevant news items, respond to questions, and make the most of your audience by interacting with them on a regular basis. Responding to questions in a timely manner can remind people that you are there and listening. This can have a positive effect on how they perceive your business over time.



5. Respond To Reviews – There’s nothing better for your reputation than responding to negative reviews by providing excellent customer service. Show that you can fix problems and improve your business. These actions show that you care about your customers, and many of them will come back to give you another chance.



Social media is one of the most powerful marketing tools available today. On top of increased sales and popularity, it’s a great way to communicate with your customers on a more personal level. Try using these social media marketing tips in your next campaign, and watch sales increase!
